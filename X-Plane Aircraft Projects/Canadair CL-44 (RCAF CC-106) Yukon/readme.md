# Canadair CL-44 (RCAF CC-106) Yukon

Based upon Jacques Braults original Bristol Britannia (updated for XP11 bu Seam MacLeod) this is a lengthened airframe as redesigned by Canadair for RCAF 
requirements under licence from Bristol Aircraft (BAE). The new paints are ongoing but an interim RCAF livery is included.

The Addition of a 3D Cockpit is still a work in progress as I learn first how to do this, and then haw to get enhansements to be included. It flies nicely 
and all that needed is in the zipped file included. It is really fun and almost awe inspiring to me to fly this elegant bird.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
